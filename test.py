Chapter 22 - Dark Magic!

Bai Yu estimated that, only after she had been scolded for half an hour did she finally finish selling the 100 food.

Fortunately, with billions of lords and a large population base, some people scolding didn’t matter. There would always be someone willing to buy.

The 100 magic crystals successfully reached her account. Bai Yu could now either upgrade the barracks or build the Bone Throne.

Bai Yu chose to build the special structure, Bone Throne. This had already been decided by Bai Yu earlier, upgrading the barracks wasn’t cost effective and building the Bone Throne would bring more straightforward buffs.

[Special Building Blueprint: Bone Throne]

[Building Rank: King Tier]

[Ability 1: Boosts unit loyalty to the lord.]

[Ability 2: Within the territory, boost lord and unit level by 1 (King Tier and below).]

[Ability 3: Within the castle, the lord gains 1.5x experience points (King Tier and below).]

[Construction Cost: 10k Wood, 10k Stone, 100 Magic Crystal, 10 Spirit Core]

"Build!"

The ten spirit cores Bai Yu had finally saved up were gone just like that, but she didn’t care. Only the used spirit cores had value, otherwise they were just rocks.

The Black Water Altar was located in the middle of the castle courtyard, directly facing the castle gate. The entrance of the gate led directly to the main hall inside the castle. At the very end, there was now a throne made of bones, with two skull armrests emitting a faint glow.

The throne was two meters high, mostly greyish white, with a rounded oval arch on top and two large bone swords crossed behind it, looking imposing and solemn.

On the seat was a built in grey cushion covered in magical runes.

Bai Yu approached and took a look at the throne. She touched the cushion on the seat, but didn't know what it was made of.

The seat of the throne was, how to say it, high kind high.

Bai Yu placed her two hands on the seat, jumped up, twisted her body, and successfully sat on the throne. Her two small feet dangled down, completely unable to reach the ground below.

Bai Yu sat there for a while, got bored, and then jumped down from it.

"It seems like not sitting on the throne is fine too. This special building just so happened to be in the form of a throne, but a table or mirror or something would work too."

The Bone Throne's increase experience range was the entire castle, but it didn't include the territory outside the castle.

So Bai Yu just needed to be inside the castle to get the 1.5 times experience rate.

Bai Yu clicked open the system and checked the info about her undead units' monster kills. Bai Yu didn't bother looking at the previous history, she just wanted to see how much experience she would gain from the kills now.

After waiting for 15 minutes, the system notification appeared.

[Your troops successfully killed level 2 wild boar, gained 15 experience points.]

Nice! Previously, a level 2 wild boar only gave 10 experience points. Now it was 5 more, which was 1.5x more.

Bai Yu only took two days to level up to level 6. Now with the 1.5x experience bonus, reaching the commander tier by the seventh day shouldn't be too hard, right?

Let's see what buffs the weapon got!

[Innate Weapon: Deathscythe of Judgement]

[Grade: Commander Tier Weapon (Upgradable)]

[Soul Condensation: 12%]

[Active Skills: Summon Undead Magic (Rank 2), Dark Magic (Rank 1)]

[Passive Skills: Attacks also damage the soul and cause a withering effect, killed enemies are converted to undead.]

Bai Yu indeed noticed two more differences. One was that she learned another kind of magic, dark magic, but only at rank one.

This Bai Yu could understand easily, it should be the same as her left eye which could also magic. It was just that it wasn't summoning and transformation magic, but dark magic.

As for this soul condensation, Bai Yu was a bit confused. What did it mean, was it some sentient artifact or what. Bai Yu always felt like she had found something high level but wasn't able to understand anything.

Whatever. Anyway, it must be a good thing!

Right now, Bai Yu was more curious about what she could do with rank 1 dark magic.

[Dark Magic (Rank 1)]

[Skill: Darkfire Bullet, a sphere of black fire that incinerates everything is launched at the enemy. Consumes 10 mana. No cooldown.]

A magic that consumed 10 mana should be very strong!

Of course, Bai Yu could use the death scythe's skills even without the scythe, it would just lack any passive buffs attached to the scythe, like having killed enemies automatically turning into undead.

Currently, that was the only passive skill that would be affected in this case, but there might be more powerful passives in the future.

After all, the scythe was Bai Yu's. What the scythe could do, Bai Yu could too. What it couldn't, Bai Yu also could.

And there would also be cases where Bai Yu would acquire skills obtained by the scythe as well. Like the undead summon magic for example. It was just that the scythe only knew the most basic undead summon magic, while Bai Yu would have all summon magic.

Bai Yu's current mana was only 50, which meant she would run out of mana after casting Darkfire Bullet just five times.

Bai Yu arrived at the castle gate and wanted to try out her skills. It was night right now. The blood red moon hung high overhead and the red moonlight spread across the land. It dispersed a bit of the darkness in this world, but also added a touch of eeriness.

Night was when high level monsters would randomly appear, and all monsters would also have doubled stats and drops. It was just that Bai Yu was still asleep in the Black Water Altar when night fell, so she didn't receive the system prompts.

Bai Yu, under the strange moonlight, saw a withered tree not far outside the castle.

I choose you!

Bai Yu slowly raised her left hand, her five fingers opened, and her palm faced the withered tree. As Bai Yu's mana was consumed, a black magic circle appeared in front of her palm, and then a black fireball shot out from the circle at the withered tree.

The black fireball had not a shred of light and Bai Yu also felt no warmth from it. It burned with strange black flames.

Boom!

The black fireball hit the withered tree and made a dull sound. The tree trunk was immediately blown apart by the fireball and the edges started burning with black flames. These black flames weren't like normal fires, but seemed to want to devour the entire tree.

In less than thirty seconds, the withered tree completely vanished from Bai Yu’s sight, to the extent that not even ashes were left.

Bai Yu was also startled by this power. The magic casted using ten mana really was powerful.

It was basically a divine tool for hiding corpses and evidence. If this some how inexplicably hit someone, even Conan wouldn't be able to solve the case.

Bai Yu’s own growth and weapon growth had allowed her overall strength to experience a magnitude increase in strength.

"Tonight will definitely be a bountiful harvest. Fellow townsman in heaven, I'll be able to avenge you soon, hehe."

Bai Yu glanced at the time, there was still a while before midnight. She had slept for four hours this evening, so she wasn't tired at all now. It was perfect for her to wait for midnight where she'll be able to summon another batch of troops.

These infinite labor power undead, how could Bai Yu not make use of their full potential?
